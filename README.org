* Semantic web forms

  Personal project to explore the possibility and the usability of dynamically
  generating forms based on the schema class name.

  
** How does it work?

   The user will enter `https://localhost:3000/form/JobPosting` in the browser,
   which would request from the server the json representation of the form schema.
   For this request, the server will return schema for a job posting as defined in
   `https://schema.org`

   The user enters `https://localhost:3000/form/` in the browser, which would
   request from the server the list of possible forms.

   When the user post a completed form, the request is sent to
   `https://localhost:3000/form/JobPosting`

   
** The selected technology

   The primary language is Clojure and Clojurescript. The backend libraries are
   - reitit
   - hugsql (with a sqlite3 DB)
   - ring
   - integrant
   - cheshire
